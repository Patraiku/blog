Welcome to my blog.

After university, my path of development as a software engineer swiftly stopped being linear. Instead of picking modules, 
I suddenly found myself in open pastures: free to pursue whatever technology I want, and study it however I desire.

This blog exists primarily to document that journey. I want to show the stuff I've been working on, share my thoughts about
things I find interesting, and show my authentic self.

To keep to the last point, none of the content of the blog is AI-generated. 
While I'm optimistic about AI, I wouldn't want my humanity to get lost in a sea of ['valuable insights' and 'new avenues'](https://gptzero.me/ai-vocabulary). 

Hopefully this blog will give you an insight into how I tackle problems and the technologies my mind drifts 
towards. Some of you may even find it enjoyable to read (no guarantees though)!

## The technical bits

I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for creating this blog. It's simple to implement and allows for efficient
creation of a static website, which I can then host (for free) on AWS S3. It offers the two features
a blog really needs: it allows me to write my thoughts, and it allows you to read them. It's also more customisable than
using something like Medium.

In other words, it's the easiest, cleanest solution that ticks all the boxes. What's not to like?

The blog's code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Patraiku/blog) (including the GitHub Actions code that deployed 
the site). This may be useful if you want to see how the blog is designed, or if you want to snoop on how 
many times I needed to fix typos in each article.
